# TreasureHunt

## Overview
Treasure Hunt is a simple game where the player must use the metal detector UI element to search for gold in the sand mounds of the arena. Collect as many as you can before the time runs out! This project uses Unreal Engine 4 and its Blueprints system to build the gameplay elements. This project was the frist that I worked on creating geometry and models for the game. It also showcases my knowledge in creating gameplay elements with the blueprints system.

## Skills I would like to showcase 
* Use of blueprints to create gameplay elements
* UI creation for tracking gameplay variables such as time, score, and treasure location 
* Basic modeling and geometry creation in UE4
